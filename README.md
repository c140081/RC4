Rivest Cipher 4 is a stream cipher designed in 1987 for RSA Security. Its algorithm uses a key of adjustable length (range of length is from 1 to 256 bytes), and produces pseudo-random bytes through a random permutation. The period of this cipher has been estimated to be above 10100. For a widely-implemented cipher like RC4, an interactive demonstration that explains its algorithm is however not found available on the Internet. This causes a need for an implementation of RC4 web demonstration.
