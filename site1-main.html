		<h1>RC4</h1>
		<p>RC4 is a stream cipher designed in 1987 by Ron Rivest for RSA Security. It is a variable key size stream cipher with byte-oriented operations. The algorithm is based on the use of a random permutation. Analysis shows that the period of the cipher is overwhelmingly likely to be greater tha 10 1000. Eight to sixteen machine operations are required per output byte, and the cipher can be expected to run very quickly in software.</p>
		<p>RC4 algorithm: a variable-length key of from 1 to 256 bytes is used to initialize a 256-byte state vector S, with elements S[0], S[1], ..., S[255]. At all times, S contains a permutation of all 8-bit numbers from 0 tthrough 255. For encrytion and decryption, a byte k is generated from S by selecting one of the 255 entries in a systematc fashion. As each value of k is generated, the entries in S are once again permuted. </p>
